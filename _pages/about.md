Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics working with [Gabriele Sicuro](https://gsicuro.github.io/) and [Pierpaolo Vivo](https://quantlaw.co.uk/#team) at the [Disordered Systems Group](https://dissyskcl.github.io/) at King's College London. I am also lucky enough to collaborate with researchers at École Normale Supérieure, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, the Flatiron Institute and TU Munich.

<strong>Research interests:</strong>
- High-dimensional asymptotics in machine learning
- Robust statistics
- Message-passing algorithms for statistical inference in high dimensions
- Agent-based modelling


Previously I obtained a MSc in Applied Mathematics from Imperial College London, culminating in a research project on agent-based modelling of opinion formation at the [Bertrand Lab](https://thibaultbertrand.com/), headed by Thibault Bertrand and in collaboration with Grigorios Pavliotis. I also hold a BA (Hons) Mathematics and Philosophy from King's College London, with a strong focus on applied mathematics, philosophy of language and logic.
